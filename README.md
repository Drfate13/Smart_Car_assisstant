## intro

This is a final year graduation project from the faculty of Engineering of Cairo university in this project we started to think about what could be done to improve the convince of a car and this was what were did in the end
## Start

We recommend creating a new enviroment as good practice as enviroments don't affect the main systems this is more of a problem in linux than windows but it's a good practice either way
We first start by running the "Install_dep.sh" file
then download the chromedriver and geckodriver and extract them to /usr/bin/(chromedriver/geckodriver)
then the 
sudo chown root:/usr/bin/(x)driver
sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/(x)driver
commands should be run with the (x) replace with the gecko and chrome at each time
then install the chrome web browser and the code is ready to be ran

## To Run 
to run the code just use the 
python main.py
